# AI_Project
Project Name: Education Visa Advisor

## Description

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a student is eligible for a visa based on their profile data. It includes data analysis, feature engineering, and multiple machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest). The project also provides a GUI for interactive EDA, model evaluation, and making predictions.

## Structure
- `src/main.py` - Main script to run the project
- `src/EDA.py` - Exploratory Data Analysis functions and visualizations
- `src/featureEngineering.py` - Feature engineering logic
- `src/naiveBayes.py` - Naive Bayes model training
- `src/decTree.py` - Decision Tree model training
- `src/rForest.py` - Random Forest model training
- `src/evalPrint.py` - Model evaluation and prediction utilities
- `src/GUI.py` - Graphical User Interface for EDA, evaluation, and prediction
- `src/visa_eligible.csv` - Dataset

## How to Run
1. Install requirements:  
   `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
2. Run the main script:  
   `python src/main.py`

## Features
- Interactive GUI for EDA, model evaluation, and predictions
- Multiple ML models: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Visualizations: categorical distributions, heatmaps, confusion matrix
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing
